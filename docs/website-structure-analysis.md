# apostolicfaith.org — Website Structure Analysis

> - Analyzed: 2026-03-14
> - Platform: Webflow CMS
> - Domain: https://apostolicfaith.org/

## Summary

The Apostolic Faith Church website (apostolicfaith.org) is built on Webflow and covers a lot: daily devotionals, a quarterly magazine, Sunday school lessons for different age groups, world news from churches in 60+ countries, sermons, podcasts, and camp meeting registration. They support 9 foreign languages, but every single page — devotional, article, lesson — has to be manually created in Webflow by copy-pasting content, uploading images, and attaching audio files. There's no automation, no API, and no pipeline connecting content creation to publishing. That's the problem we're solving.

## Key Observations

### Strengths
- Comprehensive content library (devotionals, curriculum, magazine, reports)
- Multilingual support (9 languages)
- Audio available for devotionals
- Minister-specific gated resources
- Camp meeting registration system

### Limitations & Opportunities
1. **Manual CMS management** — Webflow requires manual page creation for each article/devotional/report
2. **Translation workflow** — 9 languages with articles, devotionals, curriculum = significant manual effort; no apparent automated translation pipeline
3. **Audio production** — TTS/recorded audio for devotionals exists but unclear how scalable across languages
4. **No sitemap.xml** — SEO and discoverability limitation
5. **App details sparse** — Mobile app exists but platform/feature info unclear on website
6. **Foreign languages "under construction"** — Multilingual content appears incomplete
7. **Subscription limited to email** — No push notifications, no in-app delivery
8. **Event management** — Camp meeting registration exists, but no visible system for local church events globally
9. **No apparent API layer** — Content is Webflow-managed, not accessible via API for other services
10. **Social media fragmented** — Presence on Instagram, Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube but unclear content strategy across platforms
